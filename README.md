# PubNubQtSync

## Not a supported Qt SDK

The actual [Qt SDK is here.](https://github.com/pubnub/c-core/tree/master/qt)

The best way to build and deploy to iPhone is using the Qt Creator IDE.

Install submodules to get the PubNub c-core dependency:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

This repo is intended to interact with our [SmartDeviceLink demo project](https://github.com/pubnub/syncTemplate.git).

Don't forget to sign up for a [PubNub sub-key and pub-key](https://admin.pubnub.com/#/login).
